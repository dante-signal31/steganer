NAME
====

**steganer** â€” Library to hide a file inside another... or to recover it.

SYNOPSIS
========

| **steganer** FILE_HIDDEN HOST_FILE [**-x**|**--extract**] [**-h**|**--help**] [**-V**|**--version**]

DESCRIPTION
===========

If not run in extract mode then you are trying to hide FILE_HIDDEN inside HOST_FILE,
whereas if you set extract mode then you are trying to recover FILE_HIDDEN from
HOST_FILE.

Hiding a text file example (at first text file is too big, so we compress it before hiding):

    $ ls -l
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  926839 Sep 13 20:33 genesis.txt
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  550225 Sep 13 20:40 lena.png
    $ steganer genesis.txt lena.png
      thread 'main' panicked at 'File to be hidden is too big for this host image. Current is 926839 bytes but maximum for this image is 786336 bytes', src/stegimage.rs:142:13
      note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
    $ gzip genesis.txt 
    $ ls -l
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  322230 Sep 13 20:33 genesis.txt.gz
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  550225 Sep 13 20:40 lena.png
    $ steganer genesis.txt.gz lena.png

Extracting a hidden file example:

    $ ls -l
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  322230 Sep 13 20:33 genesis.txt.gz
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  661834 Sep 16 21:47 lena.png
    $ steganer genesis_recovered.txt.gz lena.png --extract
    $ ls -l
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  322230 Sep 13 20:33 genesis.txt.gz
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  322230 Sep 16 21:49 genesis_recovered.txt.gz
      -rw-rw-r--  1 dante dante  661834 Sep 16 21:47 lena.png

Nowadays, steganer performs steganography over images (currently PNG, BMP and PPM 
images). Method used is to store chunks of data in Least Significant Bits of image
pixels. Only metadata steganer stores inside host images is hidden chunk size, so
you must know which extension hidden file has prior extraction. Hiding quality 
depends on image_size/hidden_data_size ratio, so host image should be much bigger 
than hidden data to keep hiding unnoticed. If you realize host image gets noise after
hiding then you should chose another bigger image as host.

Options
